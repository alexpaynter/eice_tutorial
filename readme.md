# Introduction

This is a code tutorial written to accompany and clarify a data analysis project.  The associated paper is "A Comparison of Clinic and Home Spirometry as Longitudinal Outcomes in Cystic Fibrosis", currently under review with the Journal of cystic fibrosis.

This tutorial uses only artificial, demonstrative data.  The actual analysis uses data from the "Early Intervention in Cystic Fibrosis Exacerbation" study (NCT01104402).

# Approaches    

- For readers who interested in reading over the code to scan it and get a high level overview, we recommend downloading `code_tutorial.html` and opening it with any web browser (Firefox, Chrome, etc.)
- For readers who would like to run the analysis code themselves, we recommend the project repository be downloaded.  You will need the .csv files and `code_tutorial.Rmd` at a minimum.
- Any reader intersted our scheme to simulate data should look into `create_data.R`, which creates the .csv files.
